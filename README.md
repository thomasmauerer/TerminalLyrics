# TerminalLyrics
A simple script for displaying lyrics directly in the terminal.

## Requirements
		Python 2

## Installation
Just download the file 'lyrics.py' and make it executable:
		chmod u+x lyrics.py

## Usage  
		python lyrics.py -a <name_of_artist> -t <name_of_title>

## Note
Please do only use this script for private purposes (not commercial!) as it is basically just a HTML parser for [azlyrics.com](http://www.azlyrics.com/).

I was inspired by [this project](https://github.com/FrancescoGuarneri/AzLyricsAPI), but the script is completely written from scratch.
